intro to data structures


Data structures a systematic way of storing and organizing data in a memory of a computer

Algorithms ==> set of instructions for a computer to complete a task

types of data structures:
    primitive ==> built in list, tuple, set, dictionary
    non primitive ==> user defined ==> trees, stack, queue, linked lists, graphs

Types of Algorithms:
`   1. Recursive Algorithms 
    2. Devide and conquer algorithms
    3. Dynamic Programming algorithms (use memory)
    4. Greedy algorithms
    5. Brute force algorithms
    6. Randomized algorithms


Analysis of algorithms
======================
The measure of the efficiency of an algorithm using Time complexity and space complexity
constant time operations:
    1.declarations 2.assignments 3.Arithmetic operations 4. Comparison statements 5.calling functions 6.return statements

    (average case, worst case, best case)
